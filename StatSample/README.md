Scripts for Statistics

1.) sample_maker.rb

This script selects a sample group at random.

*User can choose whether or not they would like the sample
group to return to the population by selecting "Sample with replacement" OR the user can prohibit the sample group
from being selected again in the future by removing them from the pool/population.

*Script comes with 30 items currently on/around my desk as the default population.
Edit lines 1-6 to change the population. The script can also be changed to accept a text list to create a population.
