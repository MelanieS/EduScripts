Code that solves the "As I was going to St Ives" nursery rhyme:

As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Every wife had seven sacks
Every sack had seven cats
Every cat had seven kits
Kits, cats, sacks, wives.
How many were going to St Ives?


The number of travelers includes the man, his wives, sacks, cats, kittens, and the narrator.
