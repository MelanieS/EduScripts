This code "solves" the 'As I was going to St Ives' nursery rhyme:

As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Every wife had seven sacks
Every sack had seven cats
Every cat had seven kits
Kits, cats, sacks, wives.
How many were going to St Ives?


The number of travelers solved for includes the man, his wives, sacks, cats, kittens, and the narrator.

This problem was presented to me on take-home math test and I found that the most orderly way for me to
solve it was programmatically.
